# GUI Window for Mouse Functionalities
The GUI Window is built using Python's PyQt5 module, and PyCharm IDE. Each of the button's corresponding functionalities are to be mapped to them later.

## 'main' file
Initially, a blank window is displayed along with a Status window/Informative window.
On using the Key Sequence 'Ctrl+T' , the main GUI window with buttons opens up.

Main window uses a 3x3 Grid Layout using Vertical Box Layout for the 6 buttons.
All buttons are responsive and currently, the buttons intended for use will just close the main window upon click. The functionalities are to be bounded to them later.
The Window size and Button sizes are adjustable/expandable in real-time.
This window is centered by calculating the center with the help of Screen Geometry values.
The window has modifiable Transparency/Opacity, if needed.
The window is Resizable, if needed.
The window's dimensions and position can be fixed using coordinates, if needed.

There is a Status/Informative window fixed on the bottom-right position of the screen just above the taskbar.
It is Frameless and has modifiable Transparency/Opacity. 
This window's position is calculated with the help of Frame & Screen Geometry values.
The window's size adjusts automatically according to the Font Size & Character Length of the Text.
To make it Non-Obstructive, all mouse operations are disabled within the window.
The window permanently stays on top of all other active windows.
